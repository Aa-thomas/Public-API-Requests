For this project, I have built an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup.

Using the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/), the program will grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

The program will request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
